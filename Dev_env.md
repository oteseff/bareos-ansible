## Dev env
In case you would like to set a dev environment for the testing purposes,  
you could use a great role written by chrismeyersfsu.  
The provision_docker [1] role creates a container and executes the playbook on it using the docker connection driver.  
See the role readme for more details.

Use the following Dockerfiles [2] for the tests.
